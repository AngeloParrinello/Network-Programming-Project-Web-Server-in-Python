       <p align=center style="color:white">For a few days now, the riders on the bikes have been seeing each other on social networks, Carmelo Ezpeleta has unofficially launched the first date of the 2020 MotoGP championship. After two months of lockdown and hopes that seemed to fade, the return to a pseudo normality is pending. a vaccine that ends the Coronavirus nightmare. And as the days go by the Dorna program becomes clearer.

TEST 2020
Starting with the test day which will almost certainly anticipate the free practice. Scheduled for Wednesday, July 15 in Jerez, so as to allow pilots to regain confidence with their prototypes after more than four months away. A test also strongly desired by Valentino Rossi in recent days. Green light also to the private tests of the individual teams. The "winning" teams should still have 5 test days, while Aprilia and KTM could benefit from an unlimited number. However, it will be a job with the dropper given the difficulties in crossing national borders. The Austrian manufacturer would be ready to shoot in Brno or at the Sachsenring between the end of June and the beginning of July.

CALENDAR
However, the release of the calendar that will be made official in the first half of June is postponed for a few weeks. Carmelo Ezpeleta will try in every way not to cross MotoGP dates with those of Formula 1, but the goal is not simple with such a narrow window of time. Certainly 10 Grands Prix are expected, 12 at best, 16 would be a miracle. The latter hypothesis will depend on the organizers and non-European states. Races will hardly be held in Italy, Spain will be the main host country with at least 6 GPs (now certain two in Jerez and two in Catalunya). The stage at the Red Bull Ring is highly probable, the one in the Czech Republic is uncertain.

THE ENGINES
The number of engines available for each MotoGP rider is also outlined. The Honda, Yamaha, Ducati and Suzuki teams increase from seven to four engines. Aprilia and KTM (both beneficiaries of the concessions), go from nine to six engines. The houses of Noale and Mattighofen have not seen the development of the engine frozen, vice versa the other manufacturers who will not be able to evolve their engines until the end of the MotoGP 2021 season. On this point there was no agreement between KTM and Aprilia, the first willing to freeze engines like teams without concessions. Instead, the Venetian team preferred to continue with the development of its new V4 as it was a project born a few months ago. On the other hand, the Austrians have badly digested the fact that Aprilia (due to the agreement with Gresini) received the contribution of 250 thousand euros per month as the private teams. </p>
