       <p align=center style="color:white">It is a slow, very slow restart. The snapshot of Italian swimming is this: closed swimming pools, many emptied pools and the total discomfort of the entire aquatic sector. The management costs of a swimming pool are traditionally already high, including water pumps, electrical absorptions, filter washes, if we now add the costs for preparing the prevention and sanitation tools, required by the guidelines of the Ministry of Sport, the result looks bleak. In all of Italy you can swim in less than 10 pools, with the depressing prospect that some may not even reopen again. Without the large numbers of basic activities, i.e. swimming courses and schools, it is not possible to keep the systems running, the necessary funds are lacking.



In Milan there is only one swimming pool in operation, the Samuele in via Mecenate, which has resumed the activity for the agonists, athletes of national interest in the last 24 hours. Among them is Nicolò Martinenghi, Italian record holder of the 100 frogs (58 "75), 20 year old on the launching pad in the global gotha. The swimming pool of the Brebbia Swimming Club, where he grew up, lives the difficult economic reality of the other small towns: he does not have the opportunity to open just to let his champion swim, not at the moment.

Together with the coach, Marco Pedoja, Martinenghi shuttles along the A4, back and forth from Varese, where he lives, in Milan, as well as the group of blues by Gianni Leoni (Arianna Castiglioni, Matteo Rivolta, Silvia Scalia, Ilaria Scarcella) which are based in Busto Arsizio. From the kilometers needed to reach the pool to the social distance of one meter to be respected. The changing rooms are closed, you change in the stands with 60 square meters available. We enter in groups with separate entrances: those who finish do not cross those who begin.
A 4km workout, just to start again, there is no goal of close races but the psychological component of returning to water after 6 weeks of dry home training is fundamental.


"I thought much worse," the blue member of the State Police sports group confesses smiling. "I was afraid of making a lot of effort instead I found good sensations, the sensitivity is there so I'm very happy. I think my satisfaction comes mainly from a mental factor, I had a huge desire to swim after a long time. I feel privileged to be able to do so, compared to other friends of the national team who are still stuck because of this bad situation involving Italian swimming pools. The European Championships and the Olympics have been postponed to 2021, there is time to prepare, now it is important to start over in the best way. "



Marco Pedoja, the coach who shaped his pupil by transforming him into a champion, nods: "At an aerobic level Nicolò made no effort. Maybe we coaches worry too much about the break out of the water. Instead I am noting that there is no it is all this great difference between 6 weeks of detachment against the traditional 2/3 weeks that are done during the holidays ".

On a psychological level, how do you manage to stimulate a sample that does not have a medium or short-term goal?

"He is very peaceful, serene," continues Pedoja. "Before starting training here in Milan we reflected together on how to face this new horizon, we don't know what a whole summer without competitions means, Niccolò is used to reasoning in the short term, he did so even when he returned after the long stop due to injury last spring. He told me: I want to make time to qualify for the Gwanju World Cup and after two months he swam it. In the Whatsapp chat I have with my Italian coach colleagues we exchange opinions on the spirit of adaptation that our athletes will have to demonstrate. However, the truth is one, and it is no coincidence that it makes a difference: the champion is the one who knows how to adapt, always ”.



So here is the new reality of Martinenghi, of the group that swims with him temporarily in via Mecenate in Milan, as well as the group of Federica Pellegrini in Verona, or the realities of Caserta, Brescia and even Bolzano with the dives of Tania Cagnotto. The list of cities with an open swimming pool ends here. They are realities that, at the moment, across the country are a rarity. </p>
